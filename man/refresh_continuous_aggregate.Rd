\title{Refresh a continuous aggregate view}
\usage{
refresh_continuous_aggregate(
  conn = NULL,
  view_name,
  start_time = NULL,
  end_time = NULL,
  debug = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{conn}{Database connection object (optional, uses global connection if NULL)}

\item{view_name}{The name of the continuous aggregate view to refresh}

\item{start_time}{The start of the time range to refresh (can be NULL for unbounded)}

\item{end_time}{The end of the time range to refresh (can be NULL for unbounded)}

\item{debug}{Enable debug messages (optional, default FALSE)}
}
\value{
TRUE if the refresh was successful
}
\description{
Manually refreshes a continuous aggregate view for a specific time range.
This is useful when you need to ensure the view is up-to-date for a certain
period, or after bulk data changes.

# Initialize connection

# Using global connection - refresh all data
